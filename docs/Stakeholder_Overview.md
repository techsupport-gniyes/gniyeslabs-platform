**How They Work Together:**

When a member registers for your annual conference:
- System recognizes they're already a member (from IMemberGenie)
- Auto-fills their registration form with their information
- Applies member discount automatically
- Updates their member profile to show event attendance

No duplicate data entry. No manual work. It just works.

- **Track everything:** Know who registered, who checked in, and who paid

### For Your Members

## Simple Pricing

### How It Works

**Pick your organization size:** This determines your base platform cost

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  How Many Members Do You Have?                           │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│  Up to 500 members        →  $99/month                  │
│  501 to 2,000 members     →  $199/month                 │
│  2,001 to 10,000 members  →  $399/month                 │
│  10,001 to 25,000 members →  $799/month                 │
│  Over 25,000 members      →  Custom pricing             │
│                                                          │

## Why This Approach Works

### Problem We're Solving

**Old Way (Current Solutions):**
```
Member Database (Spreadsheet) ✗ Connected to anything
       +
Event Registration (Google Forms) ✗ Knows who members are
       +
Payment Processing (Manual) ✗ Integrated
       +
Email Communications (Mailchimp) ✗ Syncs with member data
       +
Website (Separate) ✗ Talks to other systems
```

**Result:** 
- Staff spends hours copying data between systems
- Members enter same information multiple times
- Reports require manual data compilation
- Nothing works together

---

**New Way (Our Platform):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Everything in One Place            │
│                                             │
│  Members ←→ Events ←→ Payments ←→ Emails   │
│                                             │
│  All data connected automatically           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:**
- Enter data once, use everywhere
- Automatic updates across the system
- Real-time reporting
- Members get seamless experience

---

## The Modular Advantage

### Why Modules Instead of One Big System?

**Pay for What You Need:**
- Small nonprofit with 300 members, no events? Just get IMemberGenie ($99 + $49 = $148/month)
- Growing association with events? Add IEventGenie when ready (+$49/month more)
- Need fundraising later? Add that module when the time comes

**Grow at Your Pace:**
- Start with membership management
- Add events when you're planning your first conference
- Add email marketing when you're ready to do newsletters
- Each module builds on the last

**Lower Risk:**
- Not investing in features you won't use
- Can pause or cancel modules if needs change
- Keep data even if you cancel (we archive it for 2 years)

---

## Security & Reliability: What You Can Trust

### Your Data Is Safe

**Bank-Level Security:**
- Same encryption banks use
- Never store credit card numbers (Stripe handles payments)
- Regular security audits
- Automatic backups every hour

**Reliable Service:**
- System designed for 99.9% uptime (less than 9 hours down per year)
- Automatic updates with no downtime
- Support team monitoring 24/7

**You Own Your Data:**
- Export everything anytime
- If you cancel, data archived for 2 years
- Can reactivate and get all your data back

---

### Can we keep our current web address?

**Yes!** You can use your own domain like membership.yourorganization.org. We provide simple instructions for your IT person or web host. It's included at no extra charge.

---

### What happens to our data if we cancel?

**Your data is safe:**
1. You decide to cancel
2. Service continues until end of billing month
3. Data becomes read-only (you can still view/export)
4. After 30 days: Data archived (we keep it safe)
5. After 2 years: We permanently delete it

You can export everything at any time. You own your data.

---

### Do our members need to learn a new system?

**Minimal learning needed:**
- Login is simple (email + password)
- Interface is intuitive (like popular websites)
- Most members figure it out without help
- Self-service portal makes it easy

Most importantly: They only learn once, then it works for both membership AND events (if you have both modules).

---

### Can we try it before committing?

**For pilot customers (before public launch):**
- Special early access pricing
- Extra support during setup
- Direct input on features
- 30-day money-back guarantee

**After public launch:**
- 14-day free trial
- No credit card required to start
- Cancel anytime

---

### What if we need a feature you don't have?

**We're actively developing!**

Current roadmap:
- **2026:** Email Marketing, Fundraising, Sponsorship Management
- **2027:** Advanced Analytics, Mobile Apps
- **Ongoing:** Your feedback shapes what we build

We prioritize features based on customer needs. As an early customer, your input matters.

---

### Is our information secure?

- Bank-level encryption (same as your online banking)
- We NEVER see credit card numbers (Stripe handles all payments)
- Regular security audits
- Compliant with payment security standards (PCI-DSS)
- Automatic backups hourly
- Two-factor authentication available

---

### How do you compare to free options like Google Forms?

**Google Forms is great for simple surveys, but:**

| Need | Google Forms | Our Platform |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| Member database | ✗ Use spreadsheet separately | ✓ Built in |
| Payment processing | ✗ Add PayPal buttons manually | ✓ Integrated |
| Member portal | ✗ Not possible | ✓ Members can log in anytime |
| Renewals | ✗ Manual tracking | ✓ Automatic reminders |
| Reporting | ✗ Manual export/analysis | ✓ Real-time dashboards |
| Integration | ✗ Everything separate | ✓ All connected |
| Support | ✗ Community forums only | ✓ Direct support |

**Bottom line:** Free tools cost staff time. Our platform saves time and provides better member experience.

---

## ROI Calculator: Is It Worth It?
